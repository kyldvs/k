## In Progress

None - Project complete.

## Blocked / Issues

None.

## Future Tasks Discovered

None.

## Notes & Decisions

- **YAML Parser**: Selected yq (installed via binary) for minimal dependencies
- **Stow Organization**: Multiple packages (zsh, tmux, git, shell) for granular control
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic backup with logging (saved to ~/.config/kyldvs/k/backups/)
- **Package Installation**: Uses sudo with password prompt
- **Git Identity**: Merge strategy that preserves existing config, appends includeIf section
- **Dotfiles Source**: Started minimal, can selectively migrate from module/dotfiles/
- **Directory Structure**: dotfiles/ at repo root for clarity
- **Shellcheck Fixes**: Fixed SC2295 and SC2155 warnings in stow.sh, SC2015 in test script

## Testing Status
- [x] Docker Compose tests: Complete
- [x] Integration tests: 9 test phases implemented and passing
- [x] Manual verification: Not required (comprehensive automated tests)

## Success Metrics Achieved

**Qualitative:**
- ✓ User can setup environment with single command (`just k setup`)
- ✓ Pulling repo updates dotfiles automatically (via symlinks)
- ✓ Configuration clearly documented and understandable
- ✓ System requires no ongoing maintenance

**Quantitative:**
- ✓ Old integration tasks deleted (6 files: 5 integrate-* + cleanup-*)
- ✓ Test coverage comprehensive (9 test phases covering all functionality)
- ✓ Setup time <5 minutes (Docker tests complete in ~2 minutes)
- ✓ Documentation complete (3 docs files + CLAUDE.md + README.md updates)

## Project Summary

Successfully implemented a complete, production-ready dotfiles system that:
1. Replaces fragmented integration tasks with unified system
2. Uses boring, reliable technology (stow, git includeIf, YAML, bash)
3. Provides automatic environment updates via symlinks
4. Includes comprehensive testing and documentation
5. Follows "less but better" principle throughout

All 59 tasks across 10 phases completed successfully.
