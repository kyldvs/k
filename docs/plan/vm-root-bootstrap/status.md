## Future Tasks Discovered
(none yet)

## Notes & Decisions
- Implementation approach: Direct (not using agents) - moderate complexity, clear patterns
- Following existing patterns from profile-init.sh and configure-main.sh
- Config stored at `/root/.config/kyldvs/k/vmroot-configure.json`
- Will commit at milestones: after phases 2, 5, 7, 8

## Testing Status
- [ ] Unit tests: Not started
- [ ] Integration tests: Not started
- [ ] Manual verification: Not started

## Next Session
1. Create step component files (Phase 1)
2. Create utility component files (Phase 2)
