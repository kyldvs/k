- All tasks are DIRECT implementation (simple file edits)
- Will commit after each major phase completion

## Testing Status
- Manual verification required after completion
- No automated tests needed (documentation-only)

## Next Session
1. Complete Phase 1: Create refactor-error-handling.md
2. Complete Phase 2: Mark bootstrap-error-recovery.md as superseded
3. Complete Phase 3: Standardize all task files
