# Integrate Git Configuration - Implementation Status

**Status**: Completed

## Progress Summary
- Tasks Completed: 18 / 18
- Current Phase: Complete
- Estimated Completion: 100%

## Currently Working On

Nothing - all tasks complete.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Task 1.1: Create git-config.sh component
  - Notes: Component created with comprehensive documentation explaining each setting
- [x] Task 2.1: Implement idempotency check
  - Notes: Uses merge.conflictstyle = zdiff3 as marker
- [x] Task 2.2: Implement user identity preservation
  - Notes: Captures user.name and user.email before config
- [x] Task 2.3: Apply 8 Git configuration settings
  - Notes: All settings applied with error handling
- [x] Task 2.4: Restore user identity
  - Notes: Re-applies identity after configuration
- [x] Task 2.5: Add error handling
  - Notes: Checks git availability, handles failures gracefully
- [x] Task 3.1: Create vm.txt manifest
  - Notes: Manifest created with header, utilities, git-config, and main
- [x] Task 3.2: Document integration in vm.sh stub
  - Notes: Updated header comments to reflect current implementation
- [x] Task 4.1: Create vm.test.sh test file
  - Notes: Test file created following vmroot.test.sh pattern
- [x] Task 4.2: Add git-config test assertions
  - Notes: Tests validate all 8 config values, identity preservation, idempotency
- [x] Task 4.3: Add test fixtures
  - Notes: Skipped - no fixtures needed for git-config tests
- [x] Task 4.4: Update test runner justfile
  - Notes: Added `just test vm` command and updated `just test all`
- [x] Task 4.5: Run tests and validate
  - Notes: All tests pass successfully
- [x] Task 5.1: Update bootstrap build to include vm.sh
  - Notes: Added vm build to build-all recipe
- [x] Task 5.2: Build vm.sh script
  - Notes: Built successfully from manifest
- [x] Task 5.3: Validate generated script
  - Notes: Script validated via successful test execution

## In Progress

None.

## Blocked / Issues

None.

## Future Tasks Discovered

None yet.

## Notes & Decisions

- Following ssh-keys.sh pattern for component structure
- Using POSIX-compliant shell (no bashisms)
- Idempotency marker: merge.conflictstyle = zdiff3

## Testing Status

- [x] Unit tests: All 8 config values tested
- [x] Integration tests: Full bootstrap test with idempotency
- [x] Manual verification: Tests pass via `just test vm`

## Implementation Summary

**Files Created:**
- `bootstrap/lib/steps/git-config.sh` - Main component (120 lines)
- `bootstrap/lib/utils/header-vm.sh` - VM bootstrap header
- `bootstrap/lib/steps/vm-main.sh` - VM main flow
- `bootstrap/manifests/vm.txt` - VM build manifest
- `src/tests/tests/vm.test.sh` - Test suite (176 lines)
- `src/tests/run-vm.sh` - Test runner
- `src/tests/docker-compose.vm.yml` - Docker Compose config
- `src/tests/images/vm/Dockerfile` - Test container image

**Files Modified:**
- `bootstrap/vm.sh` - Generated from manifest
- `tasks/test/justfile` - Added vm test commands
- `tasks/bootstrap/justfile` - Added vm to build-all

**Test Results:**
- All 8 Git configuration settings applied correctly
- User identity (name/email) preserved as expected
- Idempotency verified (second run skips configuration)
- Zero test failures

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✓ Component file created following patterns
- ✓ Configuration applied to ~/.gitconfig
- ✓ Existing user.name and user.email preserved
- ✓ Idempotent behavior validated
- ✓ Tests added to VM bootstrap test suite
- ✓ Component follows existing bootstrap patterns

## Next Session

Project complete. Ready for `/plan-done` to archive.
