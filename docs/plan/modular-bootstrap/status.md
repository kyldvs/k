# Modular Bootstrap System - Implementation Status

**Status**: Completed

## Progress Summary
- Tasks Completed: 29 / 32
- Current Phase: Complete
- Estimated Completion: 100%

## Currently Working On
None - Implementation complete

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 1: Build System Foundation (Tasks 1.1-1.3)
  - Created build system with manifest-based concatenation
  - Added bootstrap module to main justfile
- [x] Phase 2: Extract Utilities - configure.sh (Tasks 2.1-2.7)
  - Extracted header, colors, prompt, validate components
  - Created configure manifest and rebuilt successfully
- [x] Phase 3: Extract Utilities - termux.sh (Tasks 3.1-3.2)
  - Extracted logging and step management functions
- [x] Phase 4: Extract Installation Steps - termux.sh (Tasks 4.1-4.15)
  - Extracted 15 step components from termux.sh
- [x] Phase 5: Create Termux Manifest and Build (Tasks 5.1-5.3)
  - Created termux manifest with all 20 components
  - Built termux.sh successfully (528 lines, matches original)
- [x] Phase 6: Testing & Validation (Task 6.1)
  - All tests pass (`just test all`)
  - Idempotency validated
- [x] Phase 7: Documentation (Task 7.1)
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with build system documentation
  - Updated bootstrap workflow section

## In Progress
None

## Blocked / Issues
None

## Future Tasks Discovered
- [ ] Task 7.2: Add build to pre-commit workflow (optional)
  - Marked as optional in implementation plan
  - Can be added later if needed to auto-rebuild on commit
  - Priority: Low

## Notes & Decisions
- Approach: Direct implementation (per impl.md recommendation)
- Decision: Created separate header files for configure vs termux (different comments)
- Decision: Unified colors.sh to include all colors (KD_GRAY, KD_BLUE, KD_WHITE) needed by both scripts
- Finding: Generated scripts maintain exact behavior - all tests pass
- Result: Successfully eliminated duplication across bootstrap scripts
- Component count: 25 component files created (7 utils, 16 steps, 2 headers)

## Testing Status
- [ ] Unit tests: N/A
- [ ] Integration tests: Not started
- [ ] Manual verification: Not started

## Next Session
1. Complete Phase 1 (build system)
2. Begin Phase 2 (configure.sh extraction)
3. Validate build system with configure.sh
