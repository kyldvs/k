# Explore kyldvs/dotfiles - Implementation Plan

## Prerequisites
- Git installed and configured with SSH access to github.com/kyldvs/dotfiles
- Write access to `/mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/docs/tasks/` directory
- Working directory: `/mnt/kad/kyldvs/k`
- task-writer agent available for creating child tasks

## Architecture Overview
This is a discovery task that doesn't modify code, but instead creates a structured assessment and child tasks for future implementation. The workflow:

1. Clone repository to temporary location (`module/dotfiles/`)
2. Explore and catalog configurations
3. Assess each configuration (value, complexity, priority)
4. Document findings in assessment document
5. Create child task definitions via task-writer agent
6. Clean up by moving this task to completed

**Key Files:**
- `.gitignore` - Must include `module/` entry
- `module/dotfiles/` - Temporary clone location (gitignored)
- `docs/dotfiles-assessment.md` - Assessment document (output)
- `docs/tasks/*.md` - Child task definitions (output)
- `docs/tasks-done/explore-kyldvs-dotfiles.md` - This task after completion

**Integration Points:**
- Child tasks will eventually modify: `bootstrap/vm.sh`, `bootstrap/lib/steps/`, `bootstrap/manifests/vm.txt`

## Files to Create
- `module/` - Directory for temporary clone
- `module/dotfiles/` - Cloned repository (temporary)
- `docs/dotfiles-assessment.md` - Assessment document with findings
- `docs/tasks/integrate-*.md` - Child task definitions (number depends on findings)
- `docs/tasks/cleanup-dotfiles-exploration.md` - Cleanup child task

## Files to Modify
- `.gitignore` - Add `module/` entry if not present

## Files to Move
- `docs/tasks/explore-kyldvs-dotfiles.md` â†’ `docs/tasks-done/explore-kyldvs-dotfiles.md`

## Assessment Framework

For each configuration file discovered, apply this framework:

**Value Assessment (must answer "yes" to all):**
1. Does it solve a problem VM users will actually encounter?
2. Is it terminal-only (not GUI)?
3. Would it benefit the VM development environment?
4. Is it maintainable long-term?

**Integration Complexity:**
- Simple: Direct copy or minimal adaptation
- Moderate: Requires adaptation or has few dependencies
- Complex: Heavy dependencies or significant rework needed

**Priority Assignment:**
- **High**: Critical for productivity + (simple or moderate complexity)
- **Medium**: Useful but not critical + moderate complexity, OR very useful + complex
- **Low**: Nice-to-have + any complexity, OR any value + very complex

**Decision Rule:**
Only create child tasks for High and Medium priority. Document Low priority items but do not create tasks.

## Testing Strategy
No automated tests required for this exploration task. Manual verification:

1. Verify clone location: `ls -la /mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/module/dotfiles/`
2. Verify gitignore: `git status /mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/module/` (should not be tracked)
3. Verify assessment exists: `cat /mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/docs/dotfiles-assessment.md`
4. Verify child tasks exist: `ls /mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/docs/tasks/integrate-*.md`
5. Verify cleanup task exists: `cat /mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/docs/tasks/cleanup-dotfiles-exploration.md`
6. Verify no modifications to dotfiles: `cd /mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/module/dotfiles && git status` (should be clean)
7. Verify task moved: `ls /mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/docs/tasks-done/explore-kyldvs-dotfiles.md`

## Risk Assessment

**Risk 1: SSH authentication failure when cloning**
- Mitigation: Provide HTTPS fallback URL in error handling
- Impact: Low - easy to recover with alternative method

**Risk 2: module/ directory accidentally committed**
- Mitigation: Verify .gitignore before cloning (Task 1.1)
- Impact: Medium - would bloat repository, but easily fixed with `git rm -r --cached`

**Risk 3: Too many configurations found (overwhelmed)**
- Mitigation: Apply "Less but Better" philosophy strictly - be aggressive about priority ratings
- Impact: Low - can defer many items to low priority
- Guideline: Prefer 3-5 high-priority integrations over 20+ tasks

**Risk 4: No valuable configurations found**
- Mitigation: Document explicitly in assessment that no integrations recommended
- Impact: Low - valid outcome, task still successful if properly documented

**Risk 5: Modifications accidentally made to dotfiles repo**
- Mitigation: Verify read-only status after clone (Task 1.4)
- Impact: Low - clone is shallow and temporary, worst case is re-clone

**Risk 6: Task-writer agent unavailable**
- Mitigation: Create child tasks manually using existing task patterns as templates
- Impact: Low - more manual work but same outcome

## Notes

**Important Considerations:**
- This is a one-time exploration task - not meant to be repeated
- Assessment quality is more important than speed - take time to understand each config
- Child tasks should be independently implementable without re-exploring dotfiles
- Follow "Less but Better" ruthlessly - when in doubt, rate as low priority
- Prefer adapting/extracting principles over wholesale copying
- Consider maintenance burden - every integration is code to maintain forever

**Potential Gotchas:**
- macOS-specific configs in dotfiles (skip these for Linux VM)
- GUI tool configs mixed with terminal configs (carefully filter)
- Deprecated or legacy configurations (assess if still relevant)
- Personal preferences vs broadly useful configurations (prefer latter)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Shallow clone (--depth 1) for faster cloning and smaller disk usage
- Exploration is manual and interactive - no performance concerns

**Integration Philosophy:**
Per "Less but Better" principles:
- Only integrate what solves actual problems
- Extract principles, not just copy files
- Question whether each config truly needs to exist
- Optimize for the common case (VM development environment)
- When in doubt, skip it

**Expected Outcomes:**
Based on common dotfiles patterns, likely to find:
- High priority: .gitconfig, .zshrc or .bashrc, .tmux.conf (if used)
- Medium priority: .vimrc, SSH client config, shell aliases/functions
- Low priority: Niche tool configs, macOS-specific items, GUI configs

Realistic target: 3-5 high-priority child tasks, 2-4 medium-priority tasks, remainder documented as low-priority/deferred.
