## Blocked / Issues
None

## Future Tasks Discovered
None - 7 child tasks created as planned

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions:
1. **Followed "Less but Better" strictly**: Only 6 integration tasks (3 high + 3 medium priority)
2. **Excluded all GUI tools**: aerospace, borders, sketchybar, wezterm (100% compliance)
3. **Focused on principles over copying**: Extracted valuable settings, not wholesale .zshrc copy
4. **Moderate approach for modern tools**: Only apt-available tools, documented rest for manual install
5. **Graceful degradation**: All aliases and integrations use conditional checks

### Findings:
- Repository is well-organized with clean terminal/GUI separation
- macOS/Homebrew-focused but concepts translate to Linux well
- Quality over quantity - resisted integrating everything
- All high-priority items solve daily pain points (git, tmux, shell)
- All medium-priority items provide measurable productivity gains

### Child Tasks Created:
1. integrate-git-config (High - sensible git defaults)
2. integrate-tmux-config (High - better multiplexing)
3. integrate-zsh-settings (High - history & completion)
4. integrate-shell-aliases (Medium - convenience)
5. integrate-modern-cli-tools (Medium - productivity tools)
6. integrate-shell-integrations (Medium - fzf & zoxide)
7. cleanup-dotfiles-exploration (Cleanup)

## Testing Status
Manual verification complete:
- ✓ Clone location verified: module/dotfiles/ exists
- ✓ Gitignore verified: module/ not tracked
- ✓ Assessment document exists and is complete
- ✓ 7 child tasks created in docs/tasks/
- ✓ No modifications to dotfiles repo (git status clean)

## Success Criteria Verification

From spec.md:
- ✓ Repository cloned successfully to `/mnt/kad/kyldvs/k/module/dotfiles/`
- ✓ Assessment document created with complete findings organized by priority
- ✓ At least one child task created (7 tasks created!)
- ✓ Cleanup child task created
- ✓ All child tasks follow established task documentation patterns
- ✓ No modifications made to kyldvs/dotfiles (read-only verified)
- ✓ Task ready to move to `docs/tasks-done/`

## Next Session
Task complete. Next steps:
1. Commit all work (child tasks, assessment, status)
2. Move explore-kyldvs-dotfiles.md to tasks-done/
3. Begin implementing child tasks (prioritize high-priority first)
