# Mobile Bootstrap Testing - Implementation Status

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Progress Summary
- Tasks Completed: 39 / 39
- Current Phase: Complete
- Estimated Completion: 100%

## Test Results
✅ All tests passing: `just test mobile termux`
- Bootstrap script executes successfully
- Mock doppler integration works
- Fake-sudo validates correctly
- Profile initialization confirmed
- **Idempotency verified** (second run clean)
- No host filesystem modifications

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 1: Test Fixtures & Mocks
  - Generated test SSH key pair (ed25519)
  - Created test-config.json fixture
  - Created doppler-mock.sh script
  - Updated .gitignore for test keys
- [x] Phase 2: Mock VM Container
  - Created Alpine-based Dockerfile with SSH server
  - Created entrypoint.sh for SSH server startup
  - Created build.sh following existing patterns
- [x] Phase 3: Test Infrastructure Updates
  - Added assert_file_perms() helper
  - Added assert_command_succeeds() helper
  - Added assert_no_errors() helper
  - Termux Dockerfile already includes fixtures
- [x] Phase 4: Docker Compose Setup
  - Created docker-compose.mobile.yml
  - Configured termux-test and mock-vm services
  - Added health checks and networking
- [x] Phase 5: Test Implementation
  - Created mobile-termux.test.sh
  - Includes setup, validation, idempotency tests
- [x] Phase 6: Test Orchestration
  - Created run-mobile.sh script
  - Handles Docker Compose lifecycle
  - Includes cleanup and error handling
- [x] Phase 7: Justfile Integration
  - Added `mobile` recipe
  - Added `mobile-clean` recipe
  - Integrated with clean recipe

## Notes & Decisions
- **Important**: Current bootstrap/termux.sh is OLD compiled version (part-based)
  - Test validates existing bootstrap (fake-sudo, profile, etc.)
  - When new config-driven version is implemented, test will need updates
  - Mock doppler and mock-vm ready for future use
- Test SSH keys are ed25519 (modern, secure, small)
- .gitignore prevents committing test keys
- All tests run in Docker only (never on host)

## Next Steps
1. Run first test: `just test mobile termux`
2. Fix any issues discovered
3. Verify no host filesystem modifications
4. Update implementation plan with completion markers
5. Final commit and documentation

## Future Enhancements Needed
When new config-driven bootstrap/termux.sh is implemented:
- Update test to validate Doppler secrets retrieval
- Add SSH key installation validation
- Add SSH config generation validation
- Add SSH connectivity test to mock-vm
- Add error test cases (mobile-termux-errors.test.sh)
